Microsoft Teams Bulk Policy Editor
==================================

            

I created this tool to allow for fast policy modification of multiple Teams at once.   Need to quickly lock down Giphy in a select group of Teams?  Easy with this tool, potentially time consuming in PowerShell and via the GUI.   


Because this is the initial release of the tool, you may find bugs and not all errors are being caught.  Before you rate this, if you find any issues or have any usability improvements, please suggest them in the Q/A section and I will address them. 
 If you like it right out of the box, please rate it with 5 stars.  :)



My own future thoughts for improvement include:


  *  Quickly add a team owner or member to multiple selected teams. 
  *  Whatever feedback you have. 

As with any free tool you find on the Internet, use at your own risk and review the code before you execute.
